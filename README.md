# sign-up-form

A basic registration form created as part of The Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript course. Main aim of the project was to experiment with form styling and validation.

The form and page as a whole are fully responsive and the form follows modern conventions and best practices in terms of design. The field labels move dynamically depending on whether the field is in focused, filled in, or neither of those, and validations and clear feedback on whether the user is correctly entering their data are given every step along the way.
